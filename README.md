# LFG/XLE Grammars for Chinese

Author: Chit Fung LAM (Lawrence)

This project contains grammar fragments developed in the Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) formalism. They are implemented in the Xerox Linguistic Environment (XLE) to computationally model syntactic analyses of linguistic phenomena in Mandarin Chinese. See https://ling.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de/pages/xle/ for more information about grammar engineering via XLE, including how to download and use XLE.

LFG/XLE Grammar for Chinese Aspect under Control and Inner Topicalisation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains a small LFG grammar developed via the Xerox Linguistic Environment (XLE) to computationally implement the theoretical analysis of two linguistic phenomena in Mandarin Chinese, namely Aspect under Control and Inner Topicalisation.
