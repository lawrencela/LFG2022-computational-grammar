# LFG/XLE Grammar Fragment for Mandarin Chinese (LFG2022 Conference Presentation)

Author: Chit Fung LAM (Lawrence)

This repository contains a grammar fragment developed in the Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) formalism in 2022. They are implemented in the Xerox Linguistic Environment (XLE) to computationally model syntactic analyses of linguistic phenomena in Mandarin Chinese. See https://ling.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de/pages/xle/ for more information about grammar engineering via XLE, including how to download and use XLE.

LFG/XLE Grammar for Chinese Aspect under Control and Inner Topicalisation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This LFG grammar was developed using the Xerox Linguistic Environment (XLE) to computationally implement the theoretical analysis of two linguistic phenomena in Mandarin Chinese, namely Aspect under Control and Inner Topicalisation.
